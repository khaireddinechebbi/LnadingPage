      <h2>About Designer&apos;s Haven</h2>
      <p>Designer&apos;s Haven was inspired by the stories of fashion designers who struggle to reach a broader audience. By creating this platform, we aim to provide a place for these creators to showcase their work. Our mission is to bridge the gap between designers and fashion enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
      <p>This project is part of my portfolio for Holberton School. I&apos;m grateful for the support and learning that allowed me to build this platform. <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com" target="_blank">Learn more about Holberton School</a>.</p>
